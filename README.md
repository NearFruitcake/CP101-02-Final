This is the final project for my Computer Programming class. The "Beach Volleyball Game tracker".
=================================================================================================


You have been delegated to set up a Beach Volleyball Game tracker :
Enter in Both team A and B's name which may contain spaces and allow for 20 characters in the name
Display the Scores for both teams such that the name prints within 20 columns and the score lines up (or is right justified ) showing each team on either side of the net. Example shown below based on the start
	  Beach VolleyBall  Game Tracker

Enter the Name of Team A: USA 1
Enter the Name of Team B: Brazil
Let the Games begin !  Best 2 of 3 sets win

 Current Status      Set  1
 Team A                USA 1 | Team B               Brazil
                           0 |                           0
Points will be awarded to team A or B (if an A/a or B/b is not entered it should repeat until correct as code excerpt shows)
Current Status      Set  1
 Team B               Brazil | Team A                USA 1
                          15 |                           8
Which team scored point (A or B) ?X
Which team scored point (A or B) ?B
Display will show Current Status Set 1 or Current Status Set 2 or Current Status Tie Breaker Set above the team scores and net for the correct set status
When a Set winner is awarded report the set winner and the current match set status such as the following excerpt
+++++++++ Set to Team A USA 1 +++++++++
Team A USA 1 at Set count 1 to Team B Brazil at set count 1
Report if a tie breaker set is required as Tie Breaker Required before the tie breaker match report the winner such as Match Over Team A USA 1 wins !!!
If a Match win is as the result of the tie breaker then it should be similar to Tie Breaker and Match to Team A USA 1 wins!!!
At the end of the Match report the winner start a New game If not No (indicated with a n/N) then start program from the beginning with new team names, etc.
Game Rules are as follows
Match winner goes to the Team that wins 2 of 3 games
The first to win two sets wins the match. A set is won by the first team to reach 21 points (15 points in the deciding final set) with a two-point advantage. Thus, if the score is 21â€“20 (or 15â€“14 in a final set) the set continues until a 2 point advantage
Teams switch ends of the court after every 7 points (set 1 and 2) and 5 points (set 3) played. Example excerpt
Which team scored point (A or B) ?B
 Current Status      Set  1
 Team A                USA 1 | Team B               Brazil
                           8 |                          13
